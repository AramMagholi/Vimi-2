                Vimi is a smart fruits and vegetables washer which is purposely
                designed for busy housewives who not only have to take care of
                house chores, but they also have to work. They and their family
                might skip eating fruits and vegetables that include a lot of
                minerals and vitamins throughout the day. Because of the low
                fruit and vegetable consumption, our team designed Vimi to help
                people get on track of eating healthy food with simple steps.

                        Vimi has a built-in digital weight sensor which weighs
                        whatever fruits or vegetables users place in the
                        machine. A camera will scan them to identify variety,
                        color, size, and ripeness. Vimi also has two built-in
                        nozzles that spray our special natural recyclable fruit
                        liquid washer that comes with the machine.

                        Washed fruit and veggies will be stored in special

                        purchases it. These containers balance the moisture,
                        prevent nutrients, vitamins, and minerals losses which
                        may happen with regular fridge.

                        charcoal filter to be recycled and reused for the next
                        wash. The washer also has a self-cleaning function after

                Vimi remembers all the fruits and vegetables that it washed in
                one cycle and it sends the data to the Vimi app that the user
                can install on his/her phone. The app categorizes the fruits and
                vegetables and tells the user what he/she has to eat daily
                before they start going bad! Another great feature on this app
                is that it will give the user veggies recipes based on all the
                vegetables it washed.

                        This invention was to provide a device which will
                        thoroughly wash fruit such as oranges or lemons, and
                        which will deliver the same in a clean condition. A

                        through the machine is rotated so as to expose the parts

                        A fruit washing machine was designed in 2018 which
                        mostly focused on a bigger scale, meaning that it would
                        be beneficial for the restaurants and industrial
                        industries like factories. A small scale fruit washer
                        was developed and tested for tomatoes and oranges. The
                        preliminary tests carried out on the prototype indicate
                        a satisfactory performance.

                        vegetables and fruits in Vimi. Then she goes to class in
                        the morning and all the fruits and vegetables are
                        cleaned by the time she gets back home. She places them
                        in separate Vimi containers. And then she gets a daily
                        reminder in the morning before she leaves the house.
                        This reminds her what to eat on that day before it goes
                        bad. Also, she has started to include veggies with her
                        dinner with the easy repcies she gets on her app.

                        Jenny is a nurse and also a mom who has to take care of
                        the whole family after work. As a nurse, Jenny really
                        concerns about how to keep her family healthy by eating
                        clean and fresh fruit and veggies everyday. However, the
                        working conditions don’t allow her to memorize and keep
                        track of the fruit- and-vegetables-eating habits of her
                        family. She knows about Vimi from a friend and it really
                        helps her out. Every week, Jenny will pick one of the
                        ideal fruit and veggies shopping lists from the app. By
                        doing so, the app will know what she bought so that it
                        can remind her easier. Jenny can use the washer to wash
                        everything on the weekend and store them in the fruit
                        container that is provided when she purchases the
                        machine. Even if she forgets to take the fruit out after
                        washing, Vimi can store them inside the machine at low
                        temperature for up to 8 hours. Every morning, Vimi will
                        remind or recommend to Jenny what to eat on that day, so
                        that she can prepare the fruit and veggies for her
                        family before heading to work. With Vimi, Jenny won’t be
                        worried about wasting all the fruit and veggies that are
                        left in the fridge for so long.

                        Vimi was created in 2026 by two designers Aram Magholi
                        and Thy Nguyen. The idea started from an unhealthy
                        eating habit of many people in modern days when they are
                        too busy with work that they don’t take much care of
                        themselves or their family. Many people forget about
                        consuming vitamins by eating fruits and vegetables every
                        day because it takes time to wash, or the fruit and
                        vegetables may go bad like every other day when they are
                        left in the fridge for so long. The main goal of this
                        smart fruit washer is helping busy people to get on
                        track with their daily vitamin consumption through an
                        app as a friendly reminder without worrying about
                        pesticides and harmful chemicals , especially busy
                        housewives who always want the best nutritions for their
                        family. Different from other fruit washers available on
                        the market, the smart Vimi washer was designed to be
                        more convenient and functional for users while keeping
                        the best quality of the fruit and vegetables. Vimi was
                        created to be a friend in modern families and we hope we
                        would bring the best product and service for our users.
